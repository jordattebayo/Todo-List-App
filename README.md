# Todo List App

A simple todo list app that I built with C# with the ASP.NET 5.0 framework. Built following [The Little ASP.NET Core Book](https://nbarbettini.gitbooks.io/little-asp-net-core-book) tutorial.

## Run

Download the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version for your OS. Open your command line of choice in the directory you wish to install the app and do: 

~~~powershell
git clone https://github.com/jordattebayo/Todo-List-App.git
cd Todo-List-App
dotnet run
~~~

Let me know what you think!
